# Face Recognition using Limited Face Features

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my final year project on face recognition using limited face features! This project focuses on developing a system capable of detecting and recognizing individuals, even when they are wearing masks, by leveraging specific facial features, particularly the Eye Region of Interest (ROI).

## Features
- **Eye ROI Recognition**: Focuses on the Eye Region of Interest (ROI) for facial recognition, enabling accurate identification even with limited face features.
- **Python and OpenCV**: Implements the project using Python programming language and OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers for detecting facial features.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image and video processing.
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented Machine Learning Concept for this.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: Used for detecting facial features such as eyes.
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration for project management.
